# uavsar_snow
code for using UAVSAR to estimate snow properties

```
## Directory Explanation:
- Geolocate: Geolocate, crop, and resample Uavsar SLCs to ground projection.
- Incidence Angle: Calculate look vector lengths, incidence angles from arbitrary DEM
- Polsar: Calculate alpha angle, entropy, anisotropy for Uavsar Polsar images
- SWE Inversion: Standardized function to invert SWE from phase changes using a variety of equations
